- String Formattings -
A. Create a variable called 'genre'. Give it a string value.
B. Create a variable called 'producer'. Give it a string value.
C. Create a variable called 'song'. Give it a string value.

print 'I love Python. I will repeat this word 5 times: PythonPythonPythonPythonPython.'
K. Create a variable called 'hello'. Make it equal 'Hello'.
Create a variable called 'world'. Make it equal 'World'. 
Using math operations and '.format' string-formatting method print 'Hello World!'.
L. Create a variable called 'hello'. Make it equal the date of your birthday in

M. Create a text-story using all variables created through all tasks in this
homework file. You should use multi-line strings.
N. Create a variable with a string value that will contain 4 curly brackets 
(you will fill them soon). Additionally, create 4 different variables of any type 
on your own. Using '.format' string-formatting method and those 4 variables fill 
the previous string with 4 curly brackets. Print it.
O. Perform math operations with strings in a 'f-string' string-formatting method.
P. Create a variable called 'expression'. Give it any string value.
Using a variable which you have created previously and contains 4 curly brackets
print the 'expression's value 4 times using '.format' string-formatting method.
